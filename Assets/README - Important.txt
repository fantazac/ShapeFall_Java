ShapeFall is a personal game I worked on individually from 2013 to 2015. Even though it does not currently represent the way I code and design (since I have not touched it since), I am very proud of the result as I had to research by myself how to create it without the help of anyone. This includes coding itself, animating the menus and saving keybindings/scores.

Special thanks to Nicky Kuijpers who created all the assets for the menus of ShapeFall!

------------------------------------------------------

You need to copy the ShapeFall located in the same folder as this text file and paste it on your C: drive. Currently, the assets are not in the .jar file and it requires the said assets to be at the right location. If it is not the case, the game will not start when executing the .jar file.

See images in the folder named "HowToSetupShapeFall" if necessary.
