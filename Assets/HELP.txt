Hello! Thanks for trying out ShapeFall!

**IMPORTANT** Keep the files as they are and especially where they are. Moving them somewhere else will crash the game. And you don't really want that!

**IMPORTANT#2** This game requires Java Runtime Environment to work.

------------------------------

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT STEP**

First off, copy the ShapeFall "FOLDER" from this folder and paste it on your C: local disk. This will be used to load some assets that are yet to be implemented into the .jar file itself. This is temporary but required as of now.

------------------------------

To launch the game, click on the "shapefall.jar".

Finished parts of the game: Main Menu, Settings, Controls. All the other parts are placeholders as of now.

You can only use your keyboard and not your mouse.

Goal: Change the color of the bar (at the bottom) to catch the falling shapes

To play: Start --> G (which makes the game start by default)

To pause: P (which makes the game pause by default)

If you have had a 20 shape streak, you can use U (by default) to activate the star power

Controls to change the colors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (by default)

Green = 1
Red = 2
Yellow = 3
Blue = 4
Magenta (Red-Pinkish) = 5

Colors are the default ones

Now to the settings

Controls: You can choose any letter or number for the 5 colors and to start, pause and use the star power. Press Enter to change.

Difficulty: Easy: 3 colors, shapes fall slowly
            Normal: 4 colors, shapes fall a little bit faster
            Expert: 5 colors, shapes fall somewhat fast

Audio: You can delete sandstorm.wav and place a new .wav file of your choice in the ShapeFall/music folder. 

**IMPORTANT** To stop any music, go back to this menu and press 0 then cancel.

**COPYRIGHT** All sounds/musics found in the game files are temporary and will not be in the full release if it ever reaches this point.

Colors: You can choose any of the offered colors for the 5 shapes

Shape: You can choose between squares (by default) or circles.

Have fun, enjoy and make sure to let me know of any comments, ideas, critism or anything related to the design.
